## Product Feedback App

[![Django CI](https://github.com/EclecticOwl/product-feedback-app/actions/workflows/djangoworkflow.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/EclecticOwl/product-feedback-app/actions/workflows/djangoworkflow.yml)
![Coverage](./coverage.svg)


This is a project that is heavily inspired from the website frontendmentor.io

The original project link is provided here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6

I decided to use Django for the backend and Vue for the frontend for this project.
