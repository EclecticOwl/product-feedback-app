## Product Feedback App

[![Django CI](https://github.com/EclecticOwl/product-feedback-app/actions/workflows/djangoworkflow.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/EclecticOwl/product-feedback-app/actions/workflows/djangoworkflow.yml)

This is a project that is heavily inspired from the website frontendmentor.io

Using the project link here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6

I decided to go down the route of creating the data.json into an API and the frontend will use Vue.

- Still in progress currently
